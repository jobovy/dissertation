I thank my fianc\'{e}e Phoebe for all the love and support she has
given me during my years in graduate school. The road to the PhD has
not been an easy one and I could not have done it without her.

My advisor, David W.~Hogg, has been the greatest mentor I could have
asked for. He introduced me to a field I had never thought of entering
before and showed me how wonderful and exciting it is. 

I would like to thank my mother for always encouraging me to choose my
own path, even if it involves moving 4,000 miles away. Her constant
support has been indispensable. I also thank my brother.

My special thanks also go to Phoebe's parents, Ellen and Charles,

My special thanks also go to Hans-Walter Rix. 

My classmates at NYU, especially Jeff Allen, Keith Chan, Ilias Cholis,
Lisa Goodenough, Ronnie Jansson, Tao Jiang, Eyal Kazin, Jonathan
Zrake, Sjoert van Velzen, Ronin Wu, Guangtun Zhu, Adi Zolotov, deserve
a special mention for providing an intellectually stimulating
environment.
